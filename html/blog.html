                <h1>Why It Brings Me Joy</h1>
            <p>This recipe is incredbily easy to make and so yummy! Growing up, I never liked vanilla cupcakes much . I always preferred chocolate but this recipe changed my mind! I like prepping everything ahead of time before I start putting everything together as it makes everything go much smoother. This recipe is so simple and mostly likely you will have all the ingredients at home!</p>
            <h4>Tips</h4>
            <p>First sepeate all the dry ingredients and all the wet ingridents in two different bowls and then bring together everything. Definitely leave the butter out at least an hour before so it has time to soften! If you don't have buttermilk, simply use regular milk and a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice and set aside for a half hour and you just made buttermilk!</p>
            <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
            <p>If you want to frost them, go ahead! There's a simple frosting recipe that requires very little ingridents such as vanilla extract, powdered sugar, butter, and milk and is super quick to make. Just mix together everything and you'll have frosting! If you're feeling lazy, use store-bought frosting! Just as good. Have fun baking! Let me know your thoughts below! </p>
